                Custom Neon offers returns and refunds for faulty products only. Custom Neon will make every effort to resolve the issue and may fix, replace, refund, or partially refund the product. The final resolution for faulty products, including refunds for the cost of the product and/or shipping, is decided on a case by case basis depending on the source of the fault, and is at the sole discretion of Custom Neon.

            <p className='text-[16px] text-pink text-start mb-10 mx-8'>
                Custom Neon indoor and outdoor products include a 24 month warranty that covers electrical components when used appropriately. Please be aware that Indoor Signs are not suitable for use outdoors or anywhere they might get wet. Inappropriate use will void the warranty. Resolution for faulty signs will be dependent on the source of the fault and will be determined between Custom Neon and the purchaser.

                Warranty Coverage for Hard Wired & Installed Signs
            </h3>
            <p className='text-[16px] text-pink text-start mb-10 mx-8'>
                Custom Neon bears no responsibility for any costs incurred when installing and/or uninstalling your sign. If, in the unlikely event that your sign is experiencing a presumed fault, we will request photos and videos for diagnostic purposes and may require the sign to be sent back to us for replacement or repair. If you have chosen to have your sign installed and/or hard wired, Custom Neon takes no responsibility for any costs incurred due to uninstalling and/or re-installing your sign. If your sign has been hardwired in by an electrician it is at our sole discretion to decide if the occurring fault is covered under our 24 month warranty (indoor signs only).

                Custom Neon takes all necessary care to ensure our signs are delivered safely to our customers. We use a premium express shipping service that requires a signature on delivery. The customer may request to opt-out of the signature on delivery directly through the shipping service once the shipment process has begun. Please be aware that if you choose to opt-out of the signature on delivery requirement, Custom Neon will take no responsibility for lost, missing or stolen parcels that have been marked as ‘delivered’ by the shipping service.
